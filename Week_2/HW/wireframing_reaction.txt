Wireframing is essential when it comes down to designing the user experience. 
One might be tempted to skip the wireframing altogether and go straight to 
building out the product. However, it is wiser to not take shortcuts as building 
the user experience is a group effort. Wireframing is the stage where you get 
input and feedback on designs. You know exactly what problems need to be solved 
and how to go about it. Communication is key as different groups of people prefer 
different levels of detail in the design. Wireframing requires few resources and 
helps to prevent basic problems later in the development stages.
